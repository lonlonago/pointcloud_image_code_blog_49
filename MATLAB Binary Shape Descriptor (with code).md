 â€ƒâ€ƒThe scan context descriptor is extracted from the point cloud ptCloud. The scan context descriptor is a two-dimensional global feature descriptor of the point cloud that can be used to detect cyclic closures. The function first divides the points in the 3D point cloud scan into concentric radial and azimuthal bins, and then selects the maximum z height of the midpoints of each bin, thereby computing the descriptor.
