#  First, process analysis 

    This example shows how to use the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm to register a multi-viewpoint cloud to reconstruct a 3D scene. 

##  1. Overview 

    This example stitches together a collection of point clouds captured from multiple viewpoints by Kinect to construct a larger 3D view of the scene. This example applies ICP to two consecutive point clouds. This type of reconstruction can be used to develop a 3D model of an object or to build a 3D world map for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM).

###  2.1. Point cloud downsampling 

    The registration quality depends on the data noise and the initial setting of the ICP algorithm. Preprocessing steps can be applied to filter the noise or set initial attribute values that suit your own data. In this example, the data is downsampled and preprocessed using a voxel filter with a side length of 10cm. The voxel filter divides the point cloud space into cubes, and replaces all points in the cube with the average of the points in each cube through its X, Y, and Z coordinates.

  ```  
###  2.2. ICP registration 

    To register the two point clouds, the ICP algorithm is used to perform a three-dimensional rigid transformation of the downsampled data. The first point cloud is used as the reference point cloud, and then the estimated transformation is applied to the original point cloud (which is not downsampled) of the second point cloud. After registration, the joint spot cloud and processing of overlapping points are also required. First, find the rigid transformation that aligns the second point cloud with the first point cloud. Use it to convert the second point cloud into a reference coordinate system defined by the first point cloud.

  ```  
###  2.3 Merge point clouds and deduplicate 

    The world scene can now be created with the registered data. Overlapping areas are filtered using a voxel filter with a side length of 1.5cm to reduce the storage requirements of the resulting scene point cloud and reduce the size of the merged point cloud to improve scene resolution.

##  3. Multiple point cloud registration 

    To form a larger 3D scene, repeat the same steps above to process the point cloud sequence. Use the first point cloud to establish a reference coordinate system. Convert each point cloud to a reference coordinate system. This transformation is the product of a pair of transformations.
